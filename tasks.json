These phrases can then be repeated, resequenced, transformed, etc to generate a composition. Once you have chunks that are phrases, you can apply different transforms to jazz it up.\n\nA few other things to try: (1) the step pitch block lets you jump around to different notes relative to the current note, so you don't need to always specify an absolute note; (2) the set transposition block lets you raise or lower the pitch of a phrase; (3) the interval block will add additional notes at a fixed interval, so you need not construct chords by adding individual pitch blocks to each note.\n\nOnce you have restructured your transcript, try applying some of the various transforms to your music to give it a different feel. This could include restructuring the sequence of your chunks.\n\nWrite a detailed blog post about the entire process.
